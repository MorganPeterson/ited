# It Ed. Hello.

## Installation
This weak child runs on Fidget which is being forgotten for it's younger
brother Fidget2. Fidget2 has yet to be seen and rumor has it that he is not at
all like elder Fidget. Ed runs with Fidget if you make some modifications.
Primarily, this one:

```nim
of Button.TAB:
  textBox.typeCharacters("  ")
```

This is added to onSetKey, line 233 in fidget/opengl/base.nim. Change the
number of spaces for your own liking. Or, perhaps, put in a proper tab. Ed
judges in silence.
